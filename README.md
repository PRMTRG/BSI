  Exercise 1:
  ``California Instruments, Inc., produces 3,000 computer chips per day.
  Three hundred are tested for a period of 500 operating hours each.
  During the test, six failed: two after 50 hours, two at 100 hours, one at 300 hours, and one at 400 hours.
  Find FR(%) and FR(N).``   

  Exercise 2:
  ``If 300 of these chips are used in building a mainframe computer, how many failures of the computer can be expected per month?``

  Exercise 3:
  ``An industrial machine compresses natural gas into an interstate gas pipeline.
  The compressor is on line 24 hours a day. (If the machine is down, a gas field has to be shut down until the natural gas can be compressed, so down time is very expensive.) 
  The vendor knows that the compressor has a constant failure rate of ______ failures/hr.
  What is the operational reliability after ______ hours of continuous service?``  

  Exercise 4:
  ``What is the highest failure rate for a product if it is to have a reliability 
  (or probability of survival) of ______ percent at ______ hours?  Assume that the time to failure follows an exponential distribution.``
